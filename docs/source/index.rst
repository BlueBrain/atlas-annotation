Atlas Annotation
================
Over the years the Allen Brain institute has constantly improved and updated
their brain region annotation atlases. Unfortunately the old annotation atlases
are not always aligned with the new ones. For example, the CCFv2 annotations
and the Nissl volume are not compatible with the CCFv3 annotation and the
corresponding average brain volume. This package proposes a number of methods
for deforming the Nissl volume and the CCFv2 annotations in order to re-align
them to CCFv3.
